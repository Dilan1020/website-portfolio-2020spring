# Dilan's Website Portfolio
#### This README introduces people to my cooking website

## Description
This website outlines 3 of my favorite cooking recipes. It details a general outline of proper ingredients and instructions for anyone with the proper tools to prepare these dishes. It can be navigated with the nav-bar on top of every page. The about me page features a background of my cooking history.

## Assets
All external assets are credited in `assets/ASSETS.md`. All other images found in my site are original.

## Frameworks
This site uses [one of the varius Material Bootstrap frameworks](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/). This framework is responsible for the 'cards' on the home page and the site-wide navigation bar.

## Javascript
Also, this site features an open source [JavaScript library called particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) to give the 'snowing' animation featured in the background on all of my pages.
